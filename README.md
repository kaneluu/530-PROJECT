# 530-PROJECT - Home Alarm System

### Description
Some apartments donâ€™t come with a home alarm system; we will build one at a cheap cost. This home alarm system will protect you and your loved ones from intruders. We will use an IR controller to arm and disarm the alarm. When the alarm system is armed, then the system will actively be reading from the sensor. If the sensor is tripped, then the home alarm system will start blinking, and a loud siren will play sounds.  

### Components Needed
-	Arduino
-	Resistors
-	LEDs
-	LCD
-	Breadboard
-	Ultrasonic sensor/PIR sensor/Magnetic sensor
-	IR Remote controller and IR reciever
-	Cables
-	Active Speaker
-	9V battery or USB cable to supply power

### Requirements
- User should be able to arm and disarm the system.
- Once the system is armed, the alarm needs to perform these functions:
  - Read data from the ultrasonic sensor.
    -  If the alarm is triggered:
      -  Blink lights on and off, preferably like a police car.
      -  Make a siren sound that will warn the user.
      -  User should be able to turn the alarm off.
      -  Optionally, an email or message can be sent to you, if the alarm is tripped when they are not home.
-  Possibly build a mount and display for the alarm system (if we have time).
